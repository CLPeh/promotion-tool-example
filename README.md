# PromotionTool
### Introduction  
1. The players could win the prize multiplier that has been set based on the probability, for example x5 x20 x50 times.
2. The prize multiplier will be used to determine the final prize amount (current bet x multiplier won).
3. The chance to win the prizes is the playersâ€™ current bet amount must hit the minimum bet required to be eligible.  
For example, the minimum bet set = 10.00 CNY. Hence, the players are only eligible to have a chance to win the prizes when their current bet is at least 10.00 CNY.  
4. However, the maximum bet has also been set. If the player bet exceeds the maximum bet, then the extra bet amount will not be counted.  
For example:  
Maximum bet = 100.00 CNY,   
Prize multiplier won = x100,  
Current bet amount = 200.00 CNY  
The player A current bet amount is 200.00 CNY, then the total prize won is 10,000.00 CNY (100.00 CNY x 100)
