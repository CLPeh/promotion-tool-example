## Coding Architecture
The project follows a modular architecture pattern, separating functionality into distinct modules and layers for maintainability and scalability. The architecture consists of the following components:
1. AF (Application Facade) - Handle the entire flow of business logic
2. BC (Business Component) - Implement the business logic of the application
3. DA (Data Access) - Abstract the logic required to access the underlying data stores
